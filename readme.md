# Cardrank

Currently a work in progress!

Rank an arbitrary number of items by only comparing two at a time.

Uses a adaptive topological sort based approach to rank the items reasonably efficiently.

Used for finding the values that matter to you 🍃

Watch this space!

## Run it

```
npm i
node cardRank.js
```

Or the Python version (a bit older, this was the original prototype):

```
python3 cardrank.py
```
